# Formatting Instructions for "World is as you are"

## General Rules
1.  **NO Text Removal**: Never remove any original text, word, or paragraph. The content must remain verbatim.
2.  **NO Replacement Summaries**: Do not summarize a paragraph and replace the original text with the summary. Summaries must be *additive*.
3.  **Additions Allowed**: You may add new text, summaries, explanations, or heavy-hitting quotes where appropriate to enhance understanding or visual flow.
4.  **Visuals & Interactivity**: Use visual elements (highlight boxes, timelines, duality cards, interactive toggles) to break up long blocks of text and engage the reader.
5.  **Formatting Variety**: Use bullet points, icons, numbered lists, and custom CSS classes to vary the presentation.

## Specific Techniques used so far:
-   **Highlight Boxes**: Gradient backgrounds with distinct borders for key takeaways.
-   **Duality Cards**: Side-by-side comparisons (e.g., "Struggler vs Creator") with icons.
-   **Timelines**: Vertical steps to show processes (e.g., Belief -> Logic -> Reality).
-   **Interactive Toggles**: Switches to change text content based on perspective (e.g., "Human Logic" vs "Mirror Law").
-   **Power Statements**: Large, centered, styled boxes for concluding thoughts.
-   **Icons**: FontAwesome icons to add visual cues to lists.
