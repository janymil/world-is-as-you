# Formatting Instructions for "World is as you are"

## General Rules
1.  **NO Text Removal**: Never remove any original text, word, or paragraph. The content must remain verbatim.
2.  **NO Replacement Summaries**: Do not summarize a paragraph and replace the original text with the summary. Summaries must be *additive*.
3.  **Additions Allowed**: You may add extra text, summaries, metaphors, or explanations if they complement the chapter and enhance understanding.

## Chapter Extension Rules (NEW - STRICT)
1.  **Understand the Core Philosophy**: The author describes reality as a reflection of internal state. All extensions must support this viewpoint.
2.  **NO External References**:
    *   **NEVER** mention specific authors (Neville Goddard, Bashar, Vadim Zeland, etc.).
    *   **NEVER** mention scientific fields explicitly (Quantum Physics, Mechanics).
    *   **USE** the *concepts* (state, mirror, selection) but present them as the author's own direct observation.
3.  **Voice & Tone**:
    *   **Direct & Punchy**: "You are the creator." not "According to theory..."
    *   **Metaphorical**: Use "Mirror", "Script", "Radio", "River" instead of "Superposition" or "Field".
    *   **No Jargon**: Avoid academic language. Speak to the reader's daily experience.
4.  **Add Constructive Analogies**:
    *   *Physics*: Resonance, frequency, gravity, momentum (used metaphorically).
    *   *Nature*: Growth, seasons, water flow.
    *   *Technology*: Signals, blueprints, software.
5.  **Placement**:
    *   Insert extensions *between* original paragraphs to bridge ideas.
    *   Add new sections *after* key concepts to deepen them.
    *   Do *not* dilute the original text; amplify it.

## Creativity & Visuals (New Priority)
1.  **Be Creative**: Do not just format text. **Invent visual metaphors** and **creative elements** to represent abstract concepts.
    *   *Example:* If the text mentions a "Permission Slip", create a visual ticket/coupon element.
    *   *Example:* If the text mentions a "Mirror", create a split-screen reflection card.
    *   *Example:* If the text mentions "False Gods", create a visual contrast between external idols and internal power.
2.  **Visual Props**: Use CSS and HTML to create "props" that make the concept tangible (e.g., tickets, receipts, contracts, switches).
3.  **Analogy Boxes**: Feel free to add "Analogy Cards" (e.g., The Lighthouse, The Placebo Effect) that are not in the original text but clarify the message perfectly.

## Formatting Variety
1.  **Highlight Boxes**: Gradient backgrounds with distinct borders for key takeaways.
2.  **Duality Cards**: Side-by-side comparisons (e.g., "Struggler vs Creator") with icons.
3.  **Timelines**: Vertical steps to show processes (e.g., Belief -> Logic -> Reality).
4.  **Interactive Toggles**: Switches to change text content based on perspective (e.g., "Human Logic" vs "Mirror Law").
5.  **Power Statements**: Large, centered, styled boxes for concluding thoughts.
6.  **Icons**: FontAwesome icons to add visual cues to lists.

## Chapter Consistency & Layout Rules
1.  **Color Themes**:
    *   Chapter-specific colors (e.g., Cyan for Time, Purple for Reality) must **ONLY** be used in the **Hero Section** (Title, Subtitle) and specific interactive tools that require distinct branding.
    *   The **Main Content Area** (`.book-content`) must strictly follow the **Standard Color Palette** (typically Gold/Standard text colors). Do not override global text or highlight colors in the main text area with the chapter theme.
2.  **Recapitulation Section**:
    *   **Placement**: MUST be outside and after the main `.book-content` area. It is a separate section.
    *   **Structure**:
        *   Must be **wider** than the main text area (e.g., `max-width: 1000px`).
        *   Must include a **Chapter Summary** box.
        *   Must include a **Key Words** section (visual tags).
        *   Must include interactive supportive material (Quotes, FAQs, Exercises).
## Sequential Workflow Protocol (Virtual Agents)
To ensure quality, every chapter must pass through these distinct "modes" or "agents":

1.  **The Translator (Step 1)**:
    *   **Goal**: Translate original text VERBATIM.
    *   **Rule**: No changes, no deletions, no creative flair yet. Just pure accuracy. And natural slovak translation. So each native slovak understand it. And it is fluent in slovak language. 

2.  **The Philosopher (Step 2)**:
    *   **Goal**: Extend the text with new sections.
    *   **Rule**: Apply "Author's Voice". No name-dropping. Use metaphors (Gardener, Radio, Mirror).
    *   **Task**: Insert 3-4 deep analogies or "Paradox" sections.

3.  **The Designer (Step 3)**:
    *   **Goal**: Create the interactive visual.
    *   **Rule**: No placeholders. Use custom SVG or CSS shapes.
    *   **Task**: Design a visual that explains the core concept (e.g. Tunnel vs Light).

4.  **The Coder (Step 4)**:
    *   **Goal**: Assemble HTML/CSS/JS.
    *   **Rule**: Clean code, mobile responsive, specific colors.
    *   **Task**: Write the final file.
